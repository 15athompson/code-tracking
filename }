## Caching

The tool caches comments and sentiment analysis results in the `cache_dir` specified in the configuration. This helps to avoid redundant API calls and computations, making the tool faster and more efficient.

## Logging

The tool logs all activities and errors to the `log_file` specified in the configuration. This helps in debugging and monitoring the tool.

## Error Handling

The tool includes error handling for the API key, invalid YouTube URLs, and other potential issues. Errors are logged to the log file and printed to the console.

## Sentiment Analysis

The tool uses both VADER and a transformer model for sentiment analysis. VADER provides a compound score, while the transformer model provides a more detailed breakdown of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
