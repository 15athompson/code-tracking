This is a basic implementation of a voice assistant using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning
(ML) techniques. The system will be able to understand voice commands, respond with relevant information, and
perform tasks such as setting reminders, playing music, and controlling smart home devices.

**System Components**

1. **Speech Recognition**: The first step in understanding voice commands is speech recognition. We'll use a deep
learning model, such as Kaldi or Google's Cloud Speech-to-Text API, to transcribe audio into text.
2. **Intent Identification**: Once the transcript is received, we need to identify the intent behind the user's
command. This can be done using machine learning models trained on labeled datasets of intents and corresponding
actions.
3. **Entity Extraction**: After identifying the intent, we extract relevant entities from the input text. For
example, if the user asks "What's the weather like in New York?", we need to extract the city name and use it to
look up the current weather conditions.
4. **Action Execution**: Once all the entities are extracted, we execute the corresponding action. This could be
anything from sending a reminder to controlling a smart home device.

**Technical Requirements**

1. **Programming Language**: Python
2. **Libraries and Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch (for ML), NLTK, spaCy (for NLP)
3. **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, Google Cloud Natural Language API (optional)
4. **Smart Home Device Integration**: For controlling smart home devices, we'll use APIs such as Philips Hue or
Belkin WeMo.
