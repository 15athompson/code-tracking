 Minesweeper:
 
 Input Validation: Added input validation to ensure the user enters valid row and column numbers within the board's bounds. This prevents crashes due to
   invalid input.
 2 Mine Count Validation: Added validation to ensure the number of mines entered by the user is less than the total number of cells on the board. This
   prevents impossible game scenarios.
 3 User-Friendly Error Messages: Improved error messages to be more informative and user-friendly.


1 Flag Placement:
    • Added a flags set to track placed flags.
    • Implemented place_flag(row, col) to toggle flag placement on a cell.
    • Updated print_board to display 'F' for flagged cells.
 2 User Input for Actions:
    • Added a prompt for the user to choose an action: 'r' to reveal, 'f' to flag, or 'q' to quit.
    • Implemented input validation to ensure the user enters a valid action.
 3 Game Loop:
    • Modified the game loop to handle both revealing and flagging actions based on user input.
 4 Win Condition:
    • The win condition now checks if the number of revealed cells plus the number of correctly placed flags equals the total number of non-mine cells.
 5 Improved User Experience:
    • Added more informative error messages and prompts for user input.

These changes make the Minesweeper game more advanced and user-friendly. The player can now strategically place flags to mark potential mine locations,
improving their chances of winning. The game also provides more guidance and feedback to the player, making it easier to understand and play.

Trading Bot:

I have made the following changes:

 1 Added Error Handling: The execute_trade function now includes a try-except block to handle potential errors during order placement. This will help
   prevent the bot from crashing if an order fails to execute.
 2 Improved Logging: The execute_trade function now logs the order details when an order is successfully placed. This will provide more information about
   the bot's activity.
 3 Added Comments: I have added comments to the code to explain the purpose of each function and section. This will make the code easier to understand and
   maintain.

These changes will improve the robustness and clarity of the bot. However, it's important to remember that this is a basic trading bot and should be
thoroughly backtested before deploying it in a live trading environment.

To implement further improvements to the project, I've made the following
changes:

 1 Added Logging: Integrated logging to record important events, errors, and
   trading activities. This helps in debugging and monitoring the bot's
   performance.
 2 Error Handling: Incorporated error handling using try-except blocks to
   gracefully handle potential issues like network errors or API request
   failures.
 3 Backtesting Functionality: Introduced a backtesting feature to evaluate
   the trading strategy's performance on historical data. This allows you to
   simulate trades and analyze the results before deploying the bot in live
   trading.
 4 Volatility-Based Stop-Loss: Added the Average True Range (ATR) indicator
   to calculate a more dynamic stop-loss based on market volatility.
 5 Improved Risk Management: Enhanced risk management by considering open
   positions and preventing overexposure to a single trade.
 6 Code Comments and Documentation: Added more comments and docstrings to
   improve code readability and understanding.

   Stock Analysis:

   To make the project more advanced, we can:

 1 Simulate more realistic stock price movements: Instead of a simple random walk, we can use models like Geometric
   Brownian Motion (GBM) which incorporate drift and volatility.
 2 Add trading strategies: We can implement simple trading strategies like moving average crossovers and backtest them
   against the simulated data.
 3 Visualize the results: We can use libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to create charts of stock prices, trading
   signals, and portfolio performance.
 4 Calculate performance metrics: We can calculate metrics like Sharpe Ratio and maximum drawdown to evaluate the
   performance of the trading strategies.

   To further improve the project, we can:                                                                                                                                                                                                          1 Incorporate transaction costs: Realistic trading involves brokerage fees or slippage, which can impact profitability.
   We can add a transaction cost parameter to the strategy.
 2 Implement risk management: We can add stop-loss orders to limit potential losses or adjust position sizes based on
   volatility.
 3 Explore different trading strategies: We can implement and compare the performance of other strategies like mean
   reversion or momentum trading.
 4 Optimize strategy parameters: We can use techniques like grid search or genetic algorithms to find the optimal
   parameters for a given strategy.
 5 **Use real stock ** Instead of synthetic data, we can fetch historical stock prices from APIs like Yahoo Finance or
   Alpha Vantage.

   Ok, I can add a more complex strategy based on technical indicators to stock_analysis.py.

I will add a new function calculate_technical_indicators() which will calculate the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and
the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Then I will modify the trading strategy to incorporate buy/sell
signals based on these indicators in addition to the moving average crossover.
